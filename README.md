# AlcoholInventory
My final project for Java class. A GUI Alcohol Inventory Management Application that saves data on a MySQL database, with CRUD functionality, and ability to generate an order list and export to excel file

This program contains a GUI interface that accepts user input in the form of combo boxes and text fields.
The interface contains an add product button, which adds the product to the database and updates the Jtable. 
An edit product button that generates a popup window with text fields to update the product quantities to the JTable and Database.
A delete button to delete a row in the JTable and database table. An Export to excel button that generates an order list in the form of 
a table in the database and then exports it onto an excel spreadsheet file to print.
